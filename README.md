nblue_open
==========

Blue Radios forgot to release their source code. Oops!

Blue Radios sell a bluetooth low power device called the nblue and release a library and bare ios app, presumably to help you develop. However the library is binary which makes it tough to learn. On top of that their library doesnt support bluetooth in the simulator which would be nice. 

We shall remedy this.

The original source is in the forums at http://www.blueradios.com/forum and their app is its binary is in the app store at http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nblueterm/id516628472?ls=1&mt=8
